# How do I Sign Up for Unmarshal APIs?

**Step 1:** Visit [console.unmarshal.io](https://console.unmarshal.io) and create your account to start using our free plan.

**Step 2:** Once you log in, navigate to the Account tab. An API Authentication Key is provided in the top right corner. Join Unmarshal's Discord Community and enter your Discord username / nickname to unlock the key. Simply attach the auth key (auth_key) as a query param of API urls to access a particular endpoint. The API urls are provided in our docs for your reference: [console.unmarshal.io](https://console.unmarshal.io).

**Step 3:** Choose between Startup or Enterprise, as per your requirements. The features and accessibility is described in the image below. The paid plans will give you full access to the production environment.
