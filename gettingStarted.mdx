**Step 2:** Once you login, an API Authentication Key is provided on the top right hand corner under ‘current plan’ section. This auth key allows users to access the staging environment. Simply attach the auth key (auth_key) as a query param of API urls to access a particular endpoint. The API urls are provided in our docs for your reference: [console.unmarshal.io](https://console.unmarshal.io).

**Step 3:** Since this is free to use for projects to test the API endpoints, users will need to contact us at [support@unmarshal.io](mailto:support@unmarshal.io), to upgrade their plan. This process will soon be automated and users can upgrade with a single click as we integrate with a crypto payment gateway.

Choose between `Startup`, `Scale`, or `Enterprise`, as per your requirements. The features and accessibility is described in the image below. The paid plans will give you full access to the production environment.
