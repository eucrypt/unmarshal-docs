# What is the Parser Tool?

So, you're a DApp Developer who's looking for ways to gain access to all of your smart contract's data but you don't know how? Or you're researching a project and want to gauge interest in it by monitoring events and function calls in their smart contract? There could be any number of reasons you have for wanting specific data from the blockchain. There's been no usable, non technically invasive way to do thisâ€¦ until now.

Presenting, The Unmarshal Parser

The Parser allows a user to index or save all transactions relating to any contract filtered by its events or function calls. This unique system saves you the time and resources required in developing a watcher service to filter this data, not to mention the hassle of using an external node service to get this data from in the first place.

The tool lets users access data in two formats - Metabase Dashboards and GraphQL APIs, which we will get into later in this guide.
